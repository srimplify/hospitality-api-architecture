A Modern Architecture for Hospitality

In this project we propose a modern architecture using API-led connectivity that connects various systems using a standard API to create a single view of the customer and deliver personalized guest experiences in real-time. The solution will leverage Hospitality Technology Next Generation (HTNG) trade association created API specifications for hospitality companies to exchange information such as reservation details, hotel rates, and room availability.
